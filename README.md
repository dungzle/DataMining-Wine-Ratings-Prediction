# DataMining-Wine-Ratings-Prediction
The purpose of this paper is to use the Wine Review Dataset as an example to illustrate the data collection and analytical process based on the concept of data mining. The method used for this project is based on Naïve Bayes with cross comparison, SVM, and weka generated decision tree.

The selected dataset is the “Wine Reviews” dataset from Kaggle.com (Kaggle, 2018). For each row of the dataset, there are 13 fields of information that describes a single wine, such as “country of origin”, “sale price”, “points”, “varieties”, and “testers” (Kaggle, 2018). Through a more in-depth analysis of the dataset, we aim to find the associative relationships and correlations between data using various data mining algorithms we learned in class. In finding a more profound meaning within the dataset, we would be able to understand the true nature of how effective Data Mining is and could make sense of seemingly random occurrences.
